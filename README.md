# layoffs-sql
Hello,

Sharing my next project on SQL about the Layoffs Analysis Project (2020-2023)

This project presents an analysis of global company layoffs from 2020 to 2023, based on a dataset including company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, and funds_raised_millions. The analysis involved two primary steps: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

 Data Cleaning

1. Check for Duplicates: Remove all duplicate entries.
2. Standardize Data and Fix Errors: Ensure consistency and correct errors.
3. Handle Null Values: Manage null values through imputation or removal.
4. Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows: Exclude irrelevant data.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  Key Findings:

The layoff percentages ranged from 0% to 100%, indicating varied impacts on different companies.
